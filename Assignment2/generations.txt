I would create another table named 'generation' with a column named "generation_id" that is the primary key and non null. The other column would be called "generation" that is a varchar. For the rows, the id would go from 1 to whatever. 1 could be father to son and have the value "son". 2 could be grandfather to grandson and have the value "grandson" and so on. This new table would need a one-to-many relationship with the family table.
